==================

Welcome to the repository for the blog I-Process. [I-Process](http://lsiemens.github.io) can be found at http://lsiemens.github.io. I am using a combination of tools to produce this blog. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is being used localy as the content management system along with a modified version of [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) as the theme. I am also using my fork of [Buster](https://github.com/lsiemens/buster) to generate a static copy of the local website procuced by Ghost. The fork of Buster adds support for windows and some extra options to improve the stability and presentation the resulting webpage.

Have any feedback for me? File an issue on this project and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
