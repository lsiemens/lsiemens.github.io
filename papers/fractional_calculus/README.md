title: "Papers: Fractional Calculus"
---

I have two papers on fractional calculus.

 - [Invertible Fractional Calculus](/invertible_fractional_calculus.pdf)
 - [Unifying Variable Order Fractional Derivatives](/scv_fractional_calculus.pdf)

Additionally I have a summary of my working notes on a project to define differential geometry using fractional calculus.

- [Working Notes: Fractional Geometry](/fractional_geometry_notes.md)
