My name is Luke Siemens. I am an undergrad student in the Physics and Astronomy program at the University of Victoria (UVic). In addition to my undergrad program I am also in the UVic Co-op program. So far I have had one work term where I got a Co-op position working as a research assistant for Dr. Falk Herwig, an associate professor at UVic. As of that position one of the projects I worked on was the NuGrid project. My participation in that project included optimizing and maintaining some of the NuGrid python tools, along with setting up the online documentation for the tools.

Apart from my studies, my spare time is occupied with playing the drums and programming. I have been programming as a hobby for many years, over the past five years I taught myself C/C++, JavaScript, Python and Fortran. In addition to those programming languages I have dabbled in Java, Lua and a couple other scripting languages.

If you have comments, questions or would like to contact me please email <luke@lsiemens.com>
