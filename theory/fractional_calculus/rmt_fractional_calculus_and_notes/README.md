# An attempt to derive Fractional Calculus #

define a version of fractional calculus based on an invertable derivative
operator (restrict the space of functions such that the derivative is invertable)
, and using Ramanujan's Master Theorem to create the fractional extension.

## Ideas to look into ## 
check compatibility with the Grunwald-Letnikov derivative

check compatibility with the Generalized Cauchy fractional derivative (Cauchy's
integral formula for differentiating complex functions)

check using generalized logarithms and exponentials to produce a fractional
derivative ("exp(alpha*log(d/dx)) f(x)")

look for a connection betwean essential singularites and the refrence point of
fractional calculus

look at a version of fractional calculus using RMT and invertable calculus
using hyperfunctions

Try invertable fractional calculus on functions with nonzero polynomial terms
